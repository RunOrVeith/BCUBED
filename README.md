# B3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 This function determines the extrinsic clustering quality b-cubed measure 
 using a set of known labels for a data set, and cluster assignmnets of 
 each data point stored as either vector or cell arrays where each
 cell/row represets a data point in which an array containing class or cluster
 assignments is stored. The multi-class variant (.m) should not yet be used and 
 does not scale well. The single-class variant is on the order of 1000 times
 faster than the other bcubed scoring available on pip, but the multiclass
 variant has not been implemented in python as it suffers from the same
 slow performace.

 Python and matlab implementations are provided.

## Installation
  The easiest way to install is to run the following command.
      
      pip install B3score
  
  Otherwise just clone or download the repo. 

## Inputs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       L: An NxM matrix containing class labels for each data point. Each 
          row represents the ith data point and each column contains a 0, or 1
          in the jth column indicating membership of label j.
          Alternatively, if hard class labels are available, L can be input 
          as an Nx1 vector where each entry is its class label

       K: Defined identically to L except for this variable stores cluster
          assignments for each data point

## Outputs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Fmeasure: This F-measure using the b-cubed metric
      precision: The b-cubed precision
      recall: The b-cubed recall
